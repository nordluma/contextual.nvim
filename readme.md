# Contextual

This is a plugin for storing, managing and extracting notes from projects. The
base idea is to be able to create notes and todos which have contextual
information attached to them and to keep them in sync while a project lives.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This plugin is still in early development and will have breaking changes.
